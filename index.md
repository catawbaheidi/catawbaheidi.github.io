This is my Github page that I'm creating for class. I'm a sophomore studying business at [Catawba College](https://catawba.edu).

I have a puppy named Salem who is 10 months old.

### Salem

Salem is a black labrador puppy. She has more energy than she knows what to do with and she loves to chase sticks and scrap pieces of wood.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/catawbaheidi/catawbaheidi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
